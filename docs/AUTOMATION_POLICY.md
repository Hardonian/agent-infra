# Automation Policy V2 & Governance Modes

## Execution Modes

Organizations configure one of four operational modes:

- **`ADVISORY` (Default)**: AgentMesh generates recommendations and change plans. No automated mutations are applied.
- **`APPROVAL_REQUIRED`**: Automated workflows prepare change requests; a human operator must review and approve the exact action hash.
- **`GUARDED_AUTOMATION`**: Low-risk changes (minor route weight shifts, healthy failovers) execute automatically under strict policy guardrails.
- **`FULL_POLICY_AUTOMATION`**: Complete automated progression for mature organizations that explicitly opt in.
