# Runbook: Failed Rollback

## Severity

CRITICAL (P0)

## Symptoms

- Rollback step execution reports failure.
- Provider fails to restore prior configuration.
- Traffic remains divided or degraded.

## Immediate Action

1. Activate Emergency Kill Switch:

   ```bash
   agentmesh automation freeze "failed rollback intervention"
   ```

2. Retrieve last known good signed configuration bundle:

   ```bash
   agentmesh action show [action-id]
   ```

3. Manually push signed config directly to proxy fleet:

   agentmesh proxy fleet
   ```

4. Verify proxy traffic status and unfreeze only after 100% baseline health confirmed.
